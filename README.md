A program which takes as input a text file that is comprised of several lines, where  each line indicates a student ID, his/her first name, his/her last name, and his/her grades in 4 courses.
Then it computes each student's GPA, and also organizes the inputs in an ascending manner based on students' IDs. The program also computes the average of the grades which were taken by students
in each course. Finally, it writes on a given text file the organized input and computed fields (like a table).
